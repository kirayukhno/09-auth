# NoteHub

This project is a web application built with Next.js (App Router) that implements user authentication, protected routes, and profile management.
The app supports registration, login, session checking, and logout using cookies and a dedicated backend API. It includes private and public routes, server-side and client-side rendering, and secure access control.
State management is handled with Zustand, and data fetching is managed with TanStack Query. All API requests are made with Axios, and the project is fully typed with TypeScript.
